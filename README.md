# InstaClone: the clone of Instagram login page (with user)

> The purpose of this code was a trial for cloning Instagram home page stuff, with a non-responsive page opened in a computer browser.

---

I used my own Instagram homepage as a layout reference, showing my user that was saved on machine, logged out. All the images used in the default layout was downloaded at Instagram page, without outside references - except the 'Get App' buttons.

The layout has incomplete and unused tags and classes, which means this layout is unfinished. 

### Initial purpose

> Create a landing page of Instagram homepage.

The original project belongs to [Gabriela Pinheiro](https://github.com/SpruceGabriela) and was provided by Digital Innovation One.

The reference Gabriela uses is her own Instagram landing homepage, with some specific differences that makes the differences between the original and the false page just a bit noticeable.

### The InstaClone purpose

> Create the most look-alike Instagram landing homepage possible without using any kind of framework, only HTML5 and CSS3 in the most basic commands and functions.

Some differences are noticeable because of the original formatting variances. The page has only one script (jQuery) for the image of a smartphone with a slide of screens of the device app. Any other resource are being used.
